# My portfolio

This project contains a portfolio about me.
This portfolio is information about my life experience,
jobs and what I want to present to my future employers and coworkers.

## UX

This portfolio is primarily intended for future employers and colleagues
to see what I've done and what I can do.
I have made my portfolio user friendly both for mobile, tablet and desktop.

    about, resume and contact section. This section contains links to social media platforms and a download cv button.

    that will take you to the other sections.

    hamburger menu button in the upper left corner that will take you to the other sections.
