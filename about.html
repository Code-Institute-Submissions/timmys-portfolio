                        <p>
                            I'm studying to become full stack software developer in Stockholm Sweden.
                            In my spare time I'm a hiker, traveler and active learner of technology, psychology and economics.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>    
                        <p>
                            I grew up in a small town called Katrineholm, which is about an hour by train from Stockholm.
                            I still have my family there, and also my friends and my mentor, who has taught me everything I
                            know about industry and business mentality.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>    
                        <p>
                           After my education as a welder at high school I started working for my dad's old friend at a blastering company.
                           There I learned everything from industry, paint, company management and customer service.
                           After a few years me and my girlfriend decided to change career and moved to Norway where we stayed for three years.
                           In Norway I learnt everything from working in bigger teams and how the supply chain works in different warehouses.
                           After Norway I felt I needed to take a big break from work and try to find what I really want to do with my life.
                           So I decided to fulfill an old dream that I have had for years, which was to hike through the whole of the United Kingdom.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>    
                        <p>
                            At the end of May 2018 I was off with my big bag, tent and gear and I just started walking.
                            It took me two months and three days to hike through the whole of the United Kingdom and it was the toughest and the most fun thing I have ever done.
                            I learnt extremely much during my trip. How to manage oneself through difficult and lonely times, and to come out stronger and wiser.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            After my journey I started to think about what I want to do for my future.
                            Since 2017 I have been permanently interested in blockchain and crypto and decided that is what I want to work with.
                            So that led me to start studying to become a full stack software developer. 
                            I've always been interested in technology and electronics so this profession suits me perfect.
